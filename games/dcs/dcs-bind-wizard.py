"""dcs-bind-wizard.py - capture DCS bindings, and write diff.lua

DESCRIPTION
    Full-screen wizard by default: pick an aircraft, then bind each command by
    pressing the control. Start with `Essential binds`, which is the module's
    commands ranked by how many factory HOTAS profiles bind each one, grouped
    in the order you learn an aircraft. Every change is saved at once, so
    quitting is safe at any point.
    With --generate, headless: build one diff.lua per device and exit.

KEYS
    arrows  move between commands
    RETURN  (re)bind the selected one, then press the button or move the axis
    P       propose bindings for everything still unbound, marked ?
    c / C   confirm the selected proposal / every proposal in the section
    I       invert an axis
    X       clear the binding, so the DCS default comes back
    ESC     back, cancel, redo

FILES
    dcs-bind-wizard-results.json    the bindings, and where the game is (-r)
    <module>/default.lua            read: the command list, via a lua binary
    Config/Input/<aircraft>/joystick/<device>.diff.lua   written by --generate

NOTES
    Close DCS first: it rewrites Config/Input on exit.
    Without a lua binary the command list falls back to the factory profiles:
    fewer commands, and whatever names their authors used.
    --generate also clears DCS's per-device defaults, which otherwise assign
    pitch, roll, rudder and thrust to every joystick at once.
"""

# Interactive DCS World bindings wizard + diff.lua generator for HOTAS on Linux.
#
# TUI mode (default): full-screen terminal wizard. Flow:
#
#     1. game folder comes from --game-dir (remembered in the results file,
#        so you only pass it once); the Saved Games folder inside the Proton
#        prefix is derived from it
#     2. pick the aircraft (installed modules are discovered automatically)
#     3. bind the essentials — or pick one of the game's own sections, or ALL
#
# 'Essentials' is the short list to set up first, and it tries to answer
# the question a new module actually raises — not 'which button do I
# press' but 'what is this thing and do I need it?':
#
#     * the commands are ranked by how many of the factory HOTAS profiles
#       shipped with the module bind each one, so a Hornet opens on
#       trigger, trim, sensor control and TDC rather than on the 800-odd
#       switches of its cockpit;
#     * they are grouped in the order you learn an aircraft — fly it,
#       take off and land, fight with it, sensors and radio;
#     * the selected row explains itself in the three lines above the key
#       legend: what the control does, where it sits in the real aircraft
#       and what kind of hardware it wants, and which of your two devices
#       the factory profiles put it on, and for a switch with a direction
#       (trim, the castle hat, weapon select, the TDC) which way it goes.
#       All three stay on screen while you are capturing a button — the
#       prompt gets its own line — because that is when you need them.
#
# Commands are harvested from the game files themselves: the module's
# default.lua is run through a Lua interpreter (when one is installed) for
# the full list with today's names and categories, and the factory joystick
# profiles supply the hashes of the sim's own commands plus that popularity
# score. Either way there is no hardcoded function list — the wizard works
# for any installed module.
#
# Bindings are edited in a table: every command of the section is a row
# showing its current assignment straight from the results file. Keys:
#
#     arrows  move between commands
#     RETURN  (re)bind the selected command — then press the physical
#             button / move the axis; after accepting, the cursor moves
#             to the next row so you can chain RETURN-capture-RETURN
#     I       invert an axis (stored or freshly captured)
#     X       clear the binding (the DCS default, if any, comes back)
#     ESC     back / cancel / redo
#
# Results are saved after every change, so quitting any time is safe.
#
# Generator mode (--generate): headless; builds one diff.lua per device and
# writes them into Saved Games/DCS/Config/Input/<aircraft>/joystick/.
# DCS overwrites those files on exit, so generation refuses to run while
# the game is running. Whatever they replace is copied into the backup
# folder first (core.backup; --backup-dir moves it).
#
# The generator also cleans up DCS's per-device defaults (it assigns
# pitch/roll/rudder/thrust and fire/weapon-change/cannon to EVERY joystick
# device), so a stick and a throttle never fight over the same axis.
#
# Usage:
#     dcs-bind-wizard.py                      # TUI wizard
#     dcs-bind-wizard.py --reset              # wizard from scratch
#     dcs-bind-wizard.py -r other.json        # use a different results file
#     dcs-bind-wizard.py -g -a su-25T         # write the diff.lua files
